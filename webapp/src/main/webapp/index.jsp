<h1> Hello, Welcome to The World of DevOps!!! </h1>
<h2> DevOps is a journey and a transformation process!!! </h2>
<p>DevOps is more of a culture than tools and u have to get people into the practice n inculcated into their lifestyle</p>
Agile seems fine without DevOps until deployment comes into d picture but for sure, without Agile, there is no devops.
